# 📰 Fake News Detection using LSTM

A deep learning project to detect fake news articles using an LSTM-based neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras.

## 📂 Dataset
- Combined from [Kaggle's Fake and True News datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)

## 🧠 Model
- LSTM-based neural network with embedding layers and dropout.
- Accuracy: 87% (on 40% of the dataset)
- Confusion Matrix included.

## 📊 Evaluation
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Loss & Accuracy curves
- LIME explainability (if implemented)

## ⚙️ Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
